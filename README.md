# Cutthroat_Mitochondrial_Genomes
This is the repository for analyses conducted for the study titled "Full Mitochondrial Phylogeny of Cutthroat Trout with Comments on Species Delimitation and Taxonomy"


The Map directory correponds to the R code that was used to generate the map of all Cutthroat Trout samples

The Alignment directory contains the code that was used to align the mitochondrial genomes

The Beast directory cantains the code that was used to create both Bayesian phylogenies

The Iqtree directory contains the code that was used to create and date the maximum likelihood phylogeny
