# Cutthroat_Mitochondrial_Genomes
This is the repository for analyses conducted for the study titled "Full Mitochondrial Phylogeny of Cutthroat Trout with Comments on Species Delimitation and Taxonomy"


The Map Rscript was used to make the map in the publication. While the paths on my local machine were different, all of the shape files associated with this analysis have been
added to this directory under Publication_Map. Publication_Map also has the Excel sheets with collection coordinates.
